## Hubs Hackathon - Secret Hub

At [Hubs](https://www.hubs.com/), we know how to throw a hackathon that's not only productive, but also tons of fun!

Introducing the Hubs Hackathon SPA POC App, developed during a 16-hour (more on that later) hackathon by **_yours truly_**.
This bad boy is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Google SSO](https://support.google.com/a/answer/60224?hl=en) for a seamless and personalized experience.

With this app, you can:

- Rotate the dish duty
- Reserve a parking or booth spot
- ✨Login with Google and see personalized content✨

But wait, there's more! The app was developed in just a few hours as for the most time I was playing with
[Quik](https://qwik.builder.io/), but Next.js won me over. 

So, I ditched Quik and the rest is history.
